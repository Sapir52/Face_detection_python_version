# Face detection python version
Face detection is one of the most common applications of Artificial Intelligence.

## The goal of the project:
The purpose of the project is to build a website for facial recognition.
The face will allow to predict the emotion, age, gender, race and type of emoji.

To identify age, gender and race I used a multi-output deep learning model (CNN). The model capable of predicting three distinct outputs. 
For the purpose of recognizing emotions by face I built a CNN model. In addition, I made a comparison with different classifiers.

## DataSet
In the project I used two dataStes taken from the Kaggle website.

For emotion detection:

For age, gender and race:
